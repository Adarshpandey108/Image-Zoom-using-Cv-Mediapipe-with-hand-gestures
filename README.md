Hand Gesture-Based Zoom Using OpenCV & cvzone

A real-time computer vision project that enables gesture-based zooming using OpenCV and cvzone. By detecting two hands and tracking index finger movements, users can zoom in and out of an image using natural gestures.

Features:-

Real-time hand tracking using cvzone.HandTrackingModule

Gesture-based zooming with two-hand finger detection

Dynamic image resizing based on finger distance

Smooth and responsive scaling with optimized overlays

Efficient video processing using OpenCV

How It Works:-

Raise both hands with the index and middle fingers extended.

Move hands apart to zoom in, bring them closer to zoom out.

Image scales dynamically while maintaining aspect ratio.
